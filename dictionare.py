####This nested sample of dictionary is very simplistic . Although it only includes few lines of code is pretty  much the core base of all dictionaries.

nested_dict = { 'dict1': {'key_A': 'value_A'},
                'dict2': {'key_B': 'value_B'}}

print(nested_dict)
result to print ####{'dict1': {'key_A': 'value_A'}, 'dict2': {'key_B': 'value_B'}}
